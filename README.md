# Heads up!
## ESMira on Android and iOS is about to change!
**We are redesigning the UI of the Android and iOS app. The functionality will stay the same but especially the start screen will be quite different.
We are planning on rolling out the new update at the beginning of May. if you are planning to conduct a new study soon, it might be less confusing for your participants if your start the study after the rollout**

An example of the new starting screen:

# ESMira
ESMira is a tool for running longitudinal studies (ESM, AA, EMA, ...) with completely anonymized communication with participants and data collection. Studies can be created over an online interface und participants can either use iOS, Android or a web browser.


## What are its most compelling features?

### :satellite: Fully functional offline
ESMira works without a steady internet connection. All functionality of studies are saved locally in the app and saved data are cached and will be uploaded as soon as there is an internet connection.

### :bulb: Personal Feedback
Researcher can set up complex charts that will be automatically calculated out of participants' data. These statistics can be either personalised to the participants or calculated out of all participants' data.

### :key: Completely anonymous
Each participant gets a random participant id under which all data is collected. ESMira does not collect any personal data at any time.

### :speech_balloon: Anonymous Chat
Participants can communicate with the researcher from within the app and stay completely anonymous while doing so. Additionally, researchers can send important messages to all participants of a study.



### :hammer: Flexible admin tool
The powerful admin tool allows a wide range of options to set up your study exactly as you need it.

### :bar_chart: Live statistics
The admin tool automatically calculates useful statistics about running studies. And you can always view custom charts right in the web interface.

### :mag_right: Online data viewer
You can download study data as a CSV at any time. Additionally, you can view and filter data directly in the admin tool through a flexible data viewer.

### :iphone: Web, Android and iOS
Participants can use the web interface to fill out questionnaires or use the respective native apps on iOS or Android. The [open source apps](https://github.com/KL-Psychological-Methodology/ESMira-apps) in the store are supported and maintained by us. The control over data always stays with you.

### :moneybag: Free and open source
ESMira is developed as a project at [Karl Landsteiner University](https://www.kl.ac.at/) to be used for our own studies and published for the community to use completely free of charge. But please mention ESMira when you use it for your own publications ([More information](https://github.com/KL-Psychological-Methodology/ESMira/wiki/Conditions-for-using-ESMira)).
