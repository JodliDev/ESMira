ESMira is a tool developed for research projects using Experience Sampling Method (ESM, AA, EMA, ...) designs. ESMira offers a very simple set-up process and ease of use, while being free, decentralized, and open-source. Study administrators can install ESMira on their own webspace without needing much technical knowledge, allowing them to remain independent from third-party services.
